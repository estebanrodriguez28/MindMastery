# MindMastery

MindMastery is native android app that aims to reframe a persons negative thoughts into more positive and healthy ones. The app allows users to create a "thought" which refers to a card containing the title, old thought, and new thought the user inputed for their thought. The old thought is the thought the user wants to change into the more productive new thought. Once the thought is created it is displayed on the home screen, when it is clicked it expands and there are 3 options to choose from in the top right corner: practice, edit, or delete. The delete option removes the thought from the home screen, the edit allows you to edit the thought either its title or the new or old thought, and the practice allows you to practice repeating the new thought. Our thoughts shape our life in several ways, having healthy positive ones leads to better outcomes for us and those around us.

## Step 1: Click the add button on home screen to create a new thought

## Step 5: Review the thought you just created, make sure the title and thoughts are what you intend them to be

### Now the thought you just created will be displayed with the title on the home screen

### When you click on the thought it will expand and show the thoughts you entered in addition to the title and three different options: delete, edit, and practice
#### The old thought text is bigger and more visible than the new thought text because the old thought is more prevalent in your mind than the new thought
